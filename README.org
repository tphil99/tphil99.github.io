* How I built this site

- In ~./content/~ write some ~.org~ files, which can have file-based links between them.
- Run build.sh, which runs build-site.el
- Any emacs packages used are downloaded into ~./.packages~
- The ~html~ files are saved in ~./public/~ 
- JamesIves github action automates this process
